ALU-EXPRESS MOBILE APPLICATION

The app was developed in the aim of solving a social problem at the African Leadership University. 
We wanted to leverage mobile applications to automate a process and thus improve a service/activity on campus. 
We chose to work with an application that could be used by students easily and conveniently.

The Application has 2 sides - The Student Side(alu_express_student) and the Vendor Side(alu_express)
